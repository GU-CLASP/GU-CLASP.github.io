In 2025, the Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability ([CLASP](http://gu-clasp.github.io)) achieved a major milestone: ten years of groundbreaking research and its official final year. To celebrate this journey, we warmly invite you to the CLASP Concluding Conference, a special event dedicated to showcasing the ideas, collaborations, and achievements that have defined CLASP over the past decade.

The conference will take place October 5–6, 2025, in Gothenburg, Sweden, and brings together researchers, colleagues, and friends to reflect on the project's impact and to look ahead to future directions inspired by its work.

The event is open to all who wish to join the discussion. The programme includes three keynote presentations by Alex Clark, Katrin Erk, and Joakim Nivre, and talks by current and former CLASP researchers.
