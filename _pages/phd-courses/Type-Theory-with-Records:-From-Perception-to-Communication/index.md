title: "Type Theory with Records: From Perception to Communication"
layout: phd-course
---

The course introduces TTR, a Type Theory with Records, as a framework for natural language grammar and interaction. We follow Cooper (in preparation) in taking a dialogical view of semantics. The course covers the formal foundations of TTR as well as TTR accounts of perception, intensionality, information exchange, grammar (syntax and semantics), quantification, modality and other linguistic phenomena. It also covers the relation between TTR and other type theories for natural language semantics, as well as recent extensions and applications of TTR.
