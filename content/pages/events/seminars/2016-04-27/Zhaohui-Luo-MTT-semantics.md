Abstract:

In this talk, after briefly introducing the formal semantics in modern type theories (MTT-semantics), I shall argue that it is both model-theoretic and proof-theoretic. This is due to the unique features of MTTs: they contain rich type structures that provide powerful representational means (e.g., to represent collections as types) and, at the same time, are specified proof-theoretically as rule-based systems whose sentences (judgements) can be understood inferentially.

Considered in this way, MTTs arguably have promising advantages when employed as foundational languages for formal semantics, both theoretically and practically.
