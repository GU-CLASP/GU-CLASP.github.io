The talk is part of a very new project with Elisabet Engdahl and Filippa Lindahl. I will present some preliminary data on what one can find in first position in Swedish declarative main clauses and compare the situation in Swedish with that in Dutch. I discuss how relevant the notions of topic and focus are in the light of these data.
