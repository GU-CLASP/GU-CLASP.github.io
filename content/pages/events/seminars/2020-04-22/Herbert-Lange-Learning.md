 For domain-specific applications computational grammars can be a useful resources. One challenge is that the domain experts and the grammar engineers usually are two separate parties. To bridge between the two, we present a method to learn a domain-specific grammar from a wide-coverage grammar using natural language example sentences.

We model the learning process as a constraint optimization problem and show that we can learn subgrammars from positive examples. Furthermore we show how negative examples can be included to allow for an iterative learning process and how the quality of the grammar can be improved by merging grammar rules.
