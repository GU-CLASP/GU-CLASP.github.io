This paper presents the first attempt to implement a dialogue manager based on the KoS framework for dialogue context and interaction. We utilise our own proof-theoretic implementation of Type Theory with Records (TTR) and implement a basis dialogue that involves mutual greeting. We emphasize the importance of findings in dialogue theory for designing dialogue systems which we illustrate by sketching an account for question-answer relevance.
