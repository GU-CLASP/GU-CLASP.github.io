Just as in the acquisition of other forms of expertise, learning a first language depends on three essential ingredients: exposure, practice, and feedback. Young children are exposed to the community language; they practice it in interaction with more expert speakers from around the age of 1, and they receive feedback on their practice. Fior example, adults check up on their errors with reformulations in the shape of side-sequences and embedded corrections. Adults also offer feedback on appropriate usage, ratifying the information being added to common ground. Finally, in L1 acquisition, children are learning just what one can and can't do with language, as they learn to understand and produce it. In L2 acquisition, learners typically receive much less exposure in interactive settings, receive less feedback timed to pinpoint specific errors, and have less opportunity for practice in truly interactive settings.
