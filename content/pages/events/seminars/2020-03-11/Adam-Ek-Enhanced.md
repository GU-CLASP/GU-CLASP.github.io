In this talk I introduce the framework “Enhanced Universal Dependencies”, an add-on to standard universal dependency annotations focusing on highlighting semantic relationships between words in a sentence. In the talk on-going work is presented, aimed at parsing enhanced universal dependencies in 16 languages using an encoder-decoder framework with attention.
