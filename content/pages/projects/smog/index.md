Welcome to the website of the Statistical Models of Grammaticality
(SMOG) project in the [Department of Philosophy at King\'s College
London](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/philosophy/).

SMOG is exploring the construction of an enriched stochastic model that
represents the syntactic knowledge that native speakers of English have
of their language.

We are experimenting with different sorts of language models that
contain a variety of parameters encoding properties of sentences and
probability distributions over corpora.

You can get a clearer idea of our research by reading the
[papers](https://clasp.gu.se/about/people/shalom-lappin/smog/papers/) in
the section of the website.

You can also download our
[software](https://clasp.gu.se/about/people/shalom-lappin/smog/software/)
and run our experiments on your own corpora, modifying parameters and
changing the design of the model as you think appropriate.
