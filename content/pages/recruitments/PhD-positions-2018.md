Doctoral studentship position, one or several, in Computational Linguistics

Type of employment: Fixed-term employment

The University of Gothenburg tackles society's challenges with diverse knowledge. 37 000 students and 6000 employees make the university a large and inspiring place to work and study. Strong research and attractive study programmes attract scientists and students from around the world. With new knowledge and new perspectives, the University contributes to a better future.

The Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability (CLASP) is based in FLoV at the University of Gothenburg, and is funded by a 10 year grant from the Swedish Research Council (2015-2025). CLASP is devoted to research and advanced training in the application of probabilistic modelling and machine learning methods to core issues in linguistic theory and cognition. It also addresses topics in dialogue and linguistic interaction. For a description of CLASP see http://flov.gu.se/clasp

Job assignments The successful candidate is expected to devote her or his time primarily to the completion of obligatory course work and to write a doctoral dissertation. He or she may, however, also undertake a limited amount of teaching, administration or research. Such duties will be structured bearing in mind that they are to be relevant to the doctoral student’s studies and will extend the position accordingly. As the position is funded in part by a research grant from the Swedish Research Council the successful candidate should write her or his doctoral thesis within one of the CLASP's core areas and the research should fit in within the research programme of the centre. Candidates working on one or more of these areas as well as their interface, are strongly encouraged to apply. More specifically, people in CLASP are currently conducting research in linguistics and computational linguistics using ideas from the following research areas:

Type Theory (or logics) and probability

Machine Learning including Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Theorem Proving and Bayesian Reasoning

Formal Models of Dialogue and Linguistic Interaction

Combining logical and Machine Learning/Deep Learning approaches

Models combining language and perception

Applicants with interests in these or related domains are encouraged to apply. The doctoral student is also expected to participate in the department's activities, such as workshops, seminars and conferences.

Eligibility The general entry requirements for third-cycle (doctoral) programmes are: a second-cycle qualification/degree and at least 240 higher education (HE) credits for courses of which at least 60 HE credits are awarded in the second-cycle; or equivalent training either in Sweden or abroad.

In addition, admission to the third-cycle programme in Computational Linguistics at the University of Gothenburg also requires:

At least 30 credits from second-cycle courses in subject area 1 (Computational Linguistics, Language Technology, or Natural Language Processing), including a thesis of at least 15 credits, or equivalent qualifications,
or

At least 30 credits from second-cycle courses in subject area 2 (Linguistics or Cognitive Science), including a thesis of at least 15 credits, plus at least 30 credits from first or second level courses in subject area 1 (Computational Linguistics, Language Technology, or Natural Language Processing) or subject area 3 (Computer Science, Logic, or Mathematics), or equivalent qualifications
or

At least 30 credits from second-cycle courses in subject area 3 (Computer Science, Logic or Mathematics), including a thesis of at least 15 credits, plus at least 30 credits from first or second-level courses in subject area 2 (Linguistics or Cognitive Science) or subject area 1 (Computational Linguistics, Language Technology, or Natural Language Processing), or equivalent qualifications.
The necessary English skills that are needed in order to be able to benefit from compulsory parts of the course and to be able to actively participate in seminars and similar activities, are also required.

For further information about the general and specific requirements please refer to study syllabus at the following link: http://flov.gu.se/english/education/doctoral-studies-third-cycle/postgraduate-subjects
