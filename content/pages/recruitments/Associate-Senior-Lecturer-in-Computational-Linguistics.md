# Associate Senior Lecturer in Computational Linguistics

Type of employment: Fixed-term employment, limit 4 years\
Extent: 100 %\
Location: Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science,
Gothenburg\
First day of employment: By agreement\
Reference number: PER 2016/200\
The University of Gothenburg tackles society\'s challenges with diverse
knowledge. 37 000 students and 6 000 employees make the university a
large and inspiring place to work and study. Strong research and
attractive study programmes attract scientists and students from around
the world. With new knowledge and new perspectives, the University
contributes to a better future.

The Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability (CLASP) is
based in FLoV at the University of Gothenburg, and is funded by a 10
year grant from the Swedish Research Council (2015-2025).

Subject area\
Computational Linguistics

Specific subject description\
Computational linguistics (language technology) is a subject with the
right to confer university degrees on second and third cycle level.
Second cycle is carried out in the Master in Language Technology (MLT)
program, and third cycle teaching is carried out within CLASP. For a
description of MLT, see
http://flov.gu.se/english/education/masters-second-cycle/mlt.

CLASP is devoted to research and advanced training in the application of
probabilistic modeling and machine learning methods to core issues in
linguistic theory and cognition. It also addresses topics in dialogue
and linguistic interaction. For a description of CLASP see
http://flov.gu.se/clasp.

Job assignments\
Job assignments consist of research, teaching, supervision and some
administration. Administration and teaching will make up no more than
50% of the employment.

The successful candidate is expected to devote at least half of her or
his time in research associated with the application of Machine Learning
to Computational Linguistics, and the rest in administration and
teaching, mainly within the Master\'s program in Language Technology.

The successful candidate will be a full member of the research teams
working at CLASP and will be expected to take part in the design and
implementation of research projects on an ongoing basis.

The successful candidate is expected to be physically present at the
Department and participate regularly in its activities. She/He will be
given the opportunity to develop her/his independence as researcher and
furthermore provide her/him with the qualifications that will allow
her/him to pursue other higher teaching positions. The associate senior
lecturer will, upon application, be considered for promotion to senior
lecturer.

Eligibility\
The eligible candidate must posses a PhD or equivalent scientific
competence. Usually, applicants who have achieved their PhD or
equivalent scientific competence no more than seven years before the
application deadline will be cosidered, although this is not a strict
requirement.

The employment as associate senior lecturer is described in the
Appointment procedure for teachers at the University of Gothenburg
(http://www.gu.se/digitalAssets/1500/1500024\_1457517\_appointments-procedure-for-teachers.pdf).

Assessment\
A proven track record in the following areas will be considered in the
selection process:

• research experience and skills in Computational Linguistics with a
special emphasis in Machine Learning\
• pedagogical skills within the same subject, shown by experience in the
planning and implementation of training, including supervision and
examination\
• participation in the international research community.

The applicant is expected to possess expertise in machine learning
applied to computational linguistic problems, and have done research in
this area. Applicants who are well acquainted with the issues related to
CLASP\'s main research areas will be given priority. Weight will be also
given to: a) proven interpersonal skills, b) the ability to plan and
organize research and c) the ability to communicate one's own research.

Applicants are expected to have proven skills and experience in the
teaching of machine learning and computational linguistics. The ability
to teach in core areas of linguistics (such as syntax and formal
semantics) is also desirable.

Proficiency in English is a requirement for employment, both orally and
in writing, since teaching will be carried out in the Master in Language
Technology program, which is taught in English.

In addition to the cover letter, list of scientific papers and other
documents, the applicant must provide contact information for two
references from college or university. These references should be well
acquainted with the applicant\'s previous research. The application
process may, in addition to the examination of the submission merits,
also include interviews.

According to the University of Gothenburg\'s employment regulations,
applicants who lack university teaching of at least 15 credits, or who
have not acquired similar knowledge in another way, have to undergo such
training during the first year of employment.

Specific criteria for promotion to senior lecturer

The assistant lecturer can apply for a promotion to senior lecturer
during his/her employment. The applicant must demonstrate progression in
terms of research and teaching skills during the assessment. In order to
do this, the applicant must submit proof of:

• scientific merits that exceed what is required for a doctorate both
quantitatively and qualitatively\
• the ability to independently initiate and conduct research of high
scientific quality, published in international journals\
• ability to actively and independently seek external funding for
research\
• ability to supervise, or assist in the supervision of students at
different levels\
• completion of courses in university teaching\
• completion of courses in student supervision

If these requirements are met and the applicant is granted suitable,
she/he will be promoted. Applications for promotion must be received no
later than six months before the temporary appointment as assistant
senior lecturer ends. The application may be made only once.
