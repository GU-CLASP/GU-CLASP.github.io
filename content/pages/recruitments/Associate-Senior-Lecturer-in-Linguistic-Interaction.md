The department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science, FLoV,
encompasses linguistics, practical and theoretical philosophy, logic,
and philosophy of science.

The Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability (CLASP) is
based in FLoV at the University of Gothenburg, and is funded by a 10
year grant from the Swedish Research Council (2015-2025).

Subject area\
Computational Linguistics

Specific subject description\
Computational linguistics (language technology) is a subject with the
right to confer university degrees on second and third cycle level.
Second cycle is carried out in the Master in Language Technology (MLT)
programme, and third cycle teaching is carried out within CLASP. For a
description of MLT, see
http://flov.gu.se/english/education/masters-second-cycle/mlt.

CLASP is devoted to research and advanced training in the application of
probabilistic modelling and machine learning methods to core issues in
linguistic theory and cognition. It also addresses topics in dialogue
and linguistic interaction. For a description of CLASP see
http://flov.gu.se/clasp.

Apart from being one of the research topics within CLASP, linguistic
interaction is also the main overarching theme for the research in
General Linguistics at the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and
Theory of Science (http://flov.gu.se/english/research/linguistics).
Teaching related to linguistic interaction is carried out within General
linguistics (first cycle) as well as within the MLT program (second
cycle) and CLASP (third cycle).

Job assignments\
Job assignments consist of research, teaching, supervision and some
administration. Administration and teaching will make up no more than
50% of the employment.

The successful candidate is expected to devote at least half of her or
his time in research associated with dialogue and linguistic interaction
from a Computational Linguistics perspective, and the rest in
administration and teaching, mainly within General Linguistics
undergraduate courses and the Master\'s program in Language Technology.
Much of the teaching in General Linguistics will be given in Swedish,
whereas teaching in the Master's program in Language Technology will be
given in English.

The successful candidate will be a full member of the research teams
working at CLASP and will be expected to take part in the design and
implementation of research projects on an ongoing basis.

Eligibility\
The eligible candidate must posses a PhD or equivalent scientific
competence. Mainly, applicants should be considered who have achieved
their PhD or equivalent scientific competence no more than seven years
before the application deadline.

The employment as associate senior lecturer is described in the

The most important assessment criteria in assessing are the teaching and
academic skills, and special attention will be given to the applicants
dissertation, research and teaching experience, their personal letter
and their research plan.

The applicant is expected to have expertise in dialogue and linguistic
interaction from a computational linguistics perspective, and to have
conducted research in this area. Applicants who are well acquainted with
the issues related to the clasp\'s main research areas will be given
priority. Weight will also be given to proven interpersonal skills and
the ability to plan and organize research and to communicate their own
research.

Applicants are expected to have proven skills and experience in the
teaching of dialogue and linguistic interaction from a computational
linguistics perspective. The ability to teach in the core areas of
linguistics (such as syntax and formal semantics) is also desirable.

In addition to the cover letter, list of scientific papers and other
documents, the applicant must provide contact information for two
references from college or university. These references should be well
acquainted with the applicant\'s previous research. The application
process may, in addition to the examination of the submission merits,
also include interviews.
