In the "Machine Learning, Cognitive Modeling, and Natural Language Processing" (MLCMNLP) group, we are looking at bringing cognitive modeling and theoretical linguistics together with corpus-based, machine learning approaches to both traditional and recent natural language processing problems.  We cover a variety of activities with a particular emphasis on language resource development and applications of human-collected data, be it annotations or experimental results from psycholinguistic research.

 
Members of the group:

* Asad Sayeed (group leader)

* More or less everyone else in CLASP (faculty, Ph.D. students, postdocs) who is interested in machine learning approaches and human cognitive plausibility; these days this is literally just everyone.


Ph.D. students (of whom Asad is first supervisor)

* Vidya Somashekarappa

* Axel Almquist

 
Ph.D. courses

* Machine Learning, Cognitive Modeling, and Natural Language Processing (standing project/reading course)

* It's evaluation's world, we just live in it (to be offered second half of Fall 2020)


International collaborations

* Devdatt Dubhashi's group at Chalmers

* Yuval Marton (Bloomberg/University of Washington)

* Vera Demberg's group at Saarland University

* . . . and others, we are always seeking out collaboration opportunities.


Funded projects
 * Gothenberg Research Initiative for Politically Emergent Systems (GRIPES) -- Marianne och Marcus Wallenbergstiftelsen, WASP-HS
