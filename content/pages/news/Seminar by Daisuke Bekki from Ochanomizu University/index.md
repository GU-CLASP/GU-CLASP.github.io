Cordially welcome to a seminar by Daisuke Bekki from Ochanomizu University on Wednesday 9th of December, at 13:15 online via Zoom. 

Title: "A hybrid approach toward Natural Language Understanding".

Abstract: In this talk, I will introduce and discuss our recent development of the natural language understanding (NLU) system under a "hybrid approach" between formal linguistics and machine learning, one of the alternative approaches to fully-neural NLU.   I will mainly focus on the end-to-end RTE system "ccg2lambda", which we developed in 2015, that integrates CCG parsers, formal semantics, higher-order theorem provers, and machine learning.  I will also discuss some extensions of ccg2lambda to the tasks such as visual-textual entailment and semantic textual similarity.
