On top is an illustration of the language Tsafiki with six colour words. It is spoken by the Tsáchila people of Ecuador. The image below shows an artificial language with the same number of colour words created by the researchers' agents. The Tsáchila people and the artificial agents seem to divide the spectrum in similar ways. A quantitative study of similarities in human and artificial language is found in the study.


A multi-disciplinary team of researchers from Chalmers and University of Gothenburg has developed a framework to study how language evolves as an effective tool for describing mental concepts. In a new paper, they show that artificial agents can learn how to communicate in an artificial language similar to human language. The results have been published in the scientific journal PLOS ONE.

This research lies on the border between cognitive science and machine learning. There has been an influential proposal from cognitive scientists that all human languages can be viewed as having evolved as a means to communicate concepts in a near-optimal way in the sense of classical information theory. The Gothenburg researchers' method for training the artificial agents is based on reinforcement learning, which is an area of machine learning where agents gradually learn by interacting with an environment and getting feedback. In this case, the agents start without any linguistic knowledge and learn to communicate by getting feedback on how well they succeed in communicating a mental concept.
