I am a PhD student in computational linguistics interested in semantic change and variation in dialogue. I use machine learning and corpus-based methods to study how people create and change the meaning of words through interaction.

You can find more about my work at [my website](https://winobes.github.io/about) where I occasionally [blog](https://winobes.github.io) about my research.

If you need to contact me, please use winobes@gmail.com for the moment, since the GU email servers are currently down.
