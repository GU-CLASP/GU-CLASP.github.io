I am the administrator of CLASP - a project within the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science (FLoV). My tasks involve (among other things), arranging travel and appointments, updating the CLASP website, handling invoices, purchases, conference and guest research administration.

Prior I have worked mostly with economy administration, both in the state and private sector.

I am a communicative and positive person, with a great interest in languages, other people and cultures. An interest I have had for as long as I can remember. Possibly coming from being raised in a bilingual family, with both Swedish and Finnish as native languages...

My interest in languages has led me to a lot of language studies and trips both here in Sweden as abroad. Most recently, three years at the Gothenburg University and the International Language Program with a Spanish orientation. The goal after the studies were to get an employment within the GU where I could combine my language and administrative knowledges and skills; which I gratefully managed!

You are most welcome to contact me, in Finnish, Spanish, English or, if you prefer, in good, old Swedish ;-) :-)
