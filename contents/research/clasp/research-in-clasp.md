## Dialogue Research Group

We study dialogue from a number of different perspectives, including experimental, computational, formal and qualitative methods. We have a dialogue reading group which meets fortnightly â€” for more details please see [here](/research/dialogue/reading-group).

The main people in the dialogue research group are: 

- Christine Howes (group leader) 
- Ellen Breitholtz
- Robin Cooper
- Staffan Larsson

PhD students:
- Vlad Maraev
- Bill Noble
- Sylvie Saget 

In addition, the following members of CLASP have research which overlaps with our area:
- Simon Dobnik

## Situated Language and Perception Research Group
In the Language and Perception research group we are looking at formal and distributional models (and anything in between) of language used by situated agents interacting with each other and with the physical world around them through action and perception. We investigate areas such representations of meaning in computational approaches to language, action, and perception, for example of spatial descriptions, generations and interpretation of scene description, multi-modal communication, situated dialogue systems, and other.


The group runs a bi-weekly reading-group and offers two standing PhD courses: 

- Language, Action, and Perception (for more info: English and Swedish). 
- Representation of Meaning (for more info: English and Swedish).


In 2018 we also organised (together with the Dialogue group) Workshop on Dialogue and Perception. For more details, please see here.
