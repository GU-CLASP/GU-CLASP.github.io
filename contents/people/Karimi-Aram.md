My research focuses on deep learning and machine learning, especially in NLP fields. I’d like to study about multi task learning, dynamic learning and Computational cognitive science and neurosciences. Now I’m working as a researcher and programmer in clasp (Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability).
My previous work includes studying text recommendation using Deep Neural Network. Our approach combines the metric of traditional collaborative filtering and Deep learning modelings.
