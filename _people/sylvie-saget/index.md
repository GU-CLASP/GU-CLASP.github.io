Sylvie Saget is a PhD/Doctoral Researcher in Computational Linguistics. Her research focuses on conversational agents that can talk and act autonomously such as humans, robots, virtual humans - or, generally speaking, any kind of object or system involving social interaction.

Her research focuses on the modeling of reasoning and dialogue via a transdisciplinary approach mixing philosophy (of Mind + of Science&Technology), logics and psychology. Application areas she is focusing on:

- Interaction management technologies

- Conversational / intelligent agent framework & architectures

- Responsible conception and design methods

- Social agents as tools in psychology

An approach initiated more than 15 years ago & 100% designed ***by myself***!!!

--- No worries ---Whenever I am classified as a "Past member"/not "PhD student"  --- I am active in research & PhD student!
But dealing with academic theft and sabotage takes times and deeply constraints how one can make her research public ensuring her name won't be erased and replaced!! Here in Sweden - together with men & their "friends" at the international level - you may find many women & institutions who actively take part in Matilda effect!

PhD Project: "Language as a tool: A rational and cognitive approach"

The original approach is to refashion rationality starting from a distinction between two types of information (facts and infos related to what to do or use/how to behave) and the specification of corresponding information containers (epistemic mental attitude and memory-box). Based on this distinction regarding types of information & information-containers, I am developing a cognitive and rational approach of cognition, a rational dialog model as well as a cognitive architecture.

My scientific journey:

- From Conversational AI to Pragmatics / Dialog modeling

- Pragmatics / Dialog modeling: From an activity / reasoning / process-based approach to the 1rst definition in term of kind of information/data using modern epistemology & cognitive sciences

- From modern epistemology to (Conversational) Agent theory and architecture

- And Back Again

  The key notions I am developing: Acceptance a belief-like doxastic state - caracterisation and representation of tools & much more!

Following a pityfull experience facing researchers obliged to steal others'work to fake creativity in their books, articles or to obtain grants, etc.  - making my plans their owns (easy! - steal & kill)

I had the pleasure to meet high-level professionnals who know what integrity and responsibility mean.
