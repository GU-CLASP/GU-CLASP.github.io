Ruth Kempson, Fellow of the British Academy, Member of Academia Europaea

Professor Emerita of Linguistics, [Philosophy Department, Kingâ€™s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/philosophy)

My research is broadly in linguistics as an integral part of cognitive science, with special focus on re-thinking the foundations of language in action-based terms.  My special interests currently include conversational dialogue modelling, modelling grammars as mechanisms for interaction, procedural bases for syntax and semantics, nondeterminism of language content, parallels between stances adopted in ancient Indian Buddhist philosophy and current issues of debate in cognition.   I was the lead developer of the [Dynamic Syntax](http://www.dynamicsyntax.org) framework 2000-2020.
