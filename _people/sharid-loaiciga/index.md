I'm an Associate Senior Lecturer in Computational Linguistics and the Coordinating Director of CLASP. I work in document-level NLP with a special interest in anaphoric phenomena, i.e., how humans interpret everyday referring expressions like 'it', 'this', and 'that', and how machines mimic that behavior. Applications in which I have focused include machine translation, corpora annotation, and probing and interpretability of pre-trained language models.
