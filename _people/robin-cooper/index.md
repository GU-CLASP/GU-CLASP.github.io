I am working on the following externally funded projects:
* [Dialogical Reasoning in Patients with Schizophrenia (DRiPS)](http://www.christinehowes.com/research/drips)

And then there's a never-ending book project on TTR (a type theory with records).  See <https://sites.google.com/site/typetheorywithrecords> for some literature on TTR.
