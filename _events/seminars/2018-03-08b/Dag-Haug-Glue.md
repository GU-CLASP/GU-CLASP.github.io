In this talk I explore the use of techniques from Glue semantics for composing meaning representations based on Universal Dependencies (UD) syntactic structures. The UD tree is rewritten as meaning constructors consisting of a lambda term over DRSs and a linear logic formula that guides the semantic composition. Unlike many other frameworks, Glue semantics does not presuppose a one-to-one mapping from syntax to semantics, which is useful when dealing with highly underspecified syntactic representations of the UD kind.
