## Abstract
In this talk, I will discuss challenges with modeling uncertainty and logical reasoning in natural language processing, taking question answering in complex technical domains and solving logic puzzles as exemplary tasks. Generative language models fail when it comes to analyzing imprecise statements, modality, hedging, conditions, and mathematical deductions. To this end, I will present recent work on neurosymbolic models for Bayesian reasoning scenarios that are expressed in natural language text. Our results demonstrate that large language models mostly assume causal relations but fail on evidential and explaining-away reasoning scenarios, while our neuro-symbolic approach is robust across types of reasoning. I will also present recent results on solving logic puzzles by teaching LLMs to write code for answer set programming. Finally, I will give a sneak preview on ongoing work in the areas of digital humanities and corpus-linguistic studies of discourse.
