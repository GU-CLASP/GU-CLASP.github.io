Abstract

Following a PhD course on Argument Mining -- the process of automatically identifying and classifying arguments -- we present the essence of what we have learned. This seminar will provide an overview of the most common ways to approach this task, through annotation, finding claims, support and attack, and establishing the argument structure. No prior knowledge will be necessary to enjoy our talk.
