## Abstract

This talk addresses the challenges that LLMs face in sarcasm detection, for reasons that relate to the way humans use sarcasm. I provide empirical evidence about the factors that influence the production and interpretation of sarcasm by humans. Based on such evidence, I focus on two key challenges for LLMs in sarcasm detection: 1) generalizability and 2) instances where sarcasm fails to be communicated. Through modeling experiments, I show whether these models process sarcasm in a way that aligns with human interpretation, and whether they face similar challenges to humans. Finally, I discuss how the methodological framework proposed in this talk--connecting human data with modeling experiments--can provide a more comprehensive approach to understanding natural language in general.
