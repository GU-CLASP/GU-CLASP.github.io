## Abstract
How we behave in interaction with other agents (human or artificial) depends at least partially on our first impressions of that agent, our experience with the agent over time, and the ways in which these two processes interact. In the field of Human-Robot Interaction, we can build on this knowledge to develop robots that foster a more appropriate interaction, for example in terms of trust. One powerful design element is voice. Unlike physical appearance or task context, a robot's voice can be modified relatively easily to suit different contexts and user groups. Voices carry rich social information, including identity, trustworthiness, friendliness, etc, and thus play a key role in shaping people's expectations and willingness to trust a robot. In this talk, I will present some of my studies looking at how the voice of artificial agents can influence people's trust, and how we can go beyond voice to facilitate effective and inclusive Human-Robot Interaction.
