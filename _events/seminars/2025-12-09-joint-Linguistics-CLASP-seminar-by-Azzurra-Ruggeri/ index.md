## Abstract
How do children become adaptive, curious, and effective learners in a world that is complex, uncertain, and ever-changing? In this talk, I introduce the ecological active learning framework—a perspective that moves beyond traditional, data-driven views of knowledge acquisition to highlight the dynamic, context-sensitive ways children actively seek, select, and use information. Drawing on a novel integration of developmental and computational methods, I present evidence that even young children are motivated, selective, and strategic explorers, whose learning is shaped by the structure of their environment, their goals, and their prior beliefs.
