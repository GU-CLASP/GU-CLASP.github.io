In joint work with Dan Flickinger, we provide a semi-formal review of the meaning construction process in the English Resource Grammar (ERG), which derives underspecified logical-form meaning representations for a broad range of lexical classes and syntactico-semantic constructions in English. We critically revise and extend the proposal for an MRS algebra by Copestake et al. (2001;ACL) and speculate about the applicability of ERG-style meaning construction to the more coarse-grained syntactic analyses of enhanced Universal Dependencies.
