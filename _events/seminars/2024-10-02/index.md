Abstract: People express their opinions and experiences through text and images in social media platforms. Large-scale analysis of the content that people use in social media has diverse applications spanning linguistics, geography, political science and advertising. Three specific studies will be presented (1) Point-of-interest: studying the relationship between the content of a post and the posting location type (e.g. park, restaurant); (2) Political Ads: identifying the political ideology of ad sponsors and distinguishing between official political parties and third-party organizations; (3) Influencer Content: examining influencer content, with a focus on multimodal methods to detect monetized posts.
