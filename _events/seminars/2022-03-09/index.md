Abstract: Slater’s (2007, 2015) Reinforcing Spirals Model has gotten a lot of attention in communication research in recent years. The basic idea is that people that share beliefs flock into groups that have similar media use patterns and form homogeneous groups on social media. This behavior is likely to strengthen their group-defining beliefs, and social identities over time, creating a (sometimes) vicious cycle where beliefs lead to media use patterns, that in return reinforce those beliefs (and so on) over time. In the online sphere, people often rely on group or social identities to communicate to others who they are and what matters to them. One particularly promising way to express belonging to and increase one’s status in a social group is by attacking a supposedly evil outgroup (Tajfel et al., 1979; Klein et al., 2007). My Ph.D. project is located at the intersection of these concepts and aims at better understanding how media content, online homogeneity, and intergroup conflict drive polarization between social groups. Ultimately, I also aim to provide some insights into how online encounters between hostile groups might be designed or streamlined in a way that mitigates their polarizing effect.
