Abstract:

Unnatural language semantics is the study of the meaning of words and expressions in languages that are very unlike natural languages. In this talk, I will present several case studies about how unnatural language semantics can inform us about the structure of natural languages. In particular, I will explain and present several case studies of two methods of explaining semantic universals (shared properties of meaning across the languages of the world): one arguing that such universals arise due to learnability, and another due to optimally trading-off the competing pressures of simplicity and informativeness. The talk will conclude with some discussion about the relative merits of the two explanations, other avenues where unnatural language semantics can be helpful, and some other projects in my lab.
