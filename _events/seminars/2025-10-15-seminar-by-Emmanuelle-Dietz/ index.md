## Abstract
Starting from the observation that humans often deviate from classical logic when reasoning in everyday life, we show how these extra-logical patterns can be formalized as cognitive principles. Cognitive principles are generalizations of relevant heuristics that guide human's decisions.  In this talk I will discuss two use cases, In the first case, I will show how cognitive argumentation can be integrated in the cognitive architecture, ACT-R. The argumentation process is guided by the context through the spreading activation of chunks, bridging to lower levels of cognition. The second use case is about sequential problem solving, where I will present a hybrid approach in ACT-R. Finally, we will discuss how these approaches can potentially be relevant in application.
