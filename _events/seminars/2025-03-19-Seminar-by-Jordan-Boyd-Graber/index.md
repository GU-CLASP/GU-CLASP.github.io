## Abstract

In this talk, I'll talk about how we can use silly games to understand
the strengths and weaknesses of AIs.  We first begin with games that
test memory: testing the recall of obscure facts.  While AI has been
viewed as superhuman at this task, it isn't universally so.  We show
that a new measure of adversarial datasets (the gap between humans and
computers) is decreasing but not yet closed, with computers still
struggling on abstract reasoning and knowing when they know the
correct answer.  Given these disparate skill sets, we then analyze how
we can best build human and computer teams to learn new facts and
detect false statements.  Finally, I close with a similar line of
results for another silly language game, Diplomacy, where computers
have still not reached dominance but can be used to assist human
players think strategically and detect lies.

Bio:

Jordan Boyd-Graber is a full professor at the University of Maryland.
He has worked on model evaluations for human-centered topic models,
psychologically inspired leaderboards, human–computer machine
translation, and question answering.  He also contributed new models
for improving generative models with RL, interactive approaches for
question answering, topic models, and negotiations. He and his
students have been recognized with paper awards at  EMNLP (2023), IUI
(2018), NAACL (2016), and NeurIPS (2009, 2015), and he won the 2015
Karen Spärk Jones Award and a 2017 NSF CAREER Award.

He previously was an assistant professor at the University of
Colorado, Visiting Research Scientist at Google Zürich, and Praktikant
at the Berlin-Brandenburg Akademie der Wissenschaften.  His
undergraduate degrees are in Computer Science and History at the
California Institute of Technology, and he received his PhD from
Princeton University.  His Erdös number is 2 (via Maria Klawe), and
his Bacon number is 3 (by embarrassing himself on Jeopardy!).

He lives in Silver Spring, Maryland with his wife, two roombas, three
fish, two daughters, and their 外婆.
