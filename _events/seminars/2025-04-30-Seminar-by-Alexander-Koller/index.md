## Abstract

One of the great promises that people connect with LLMs is that they can make complex problem-solving with computers accessible to lay users. Unlike optimal solvers (e.g. for planning or linear programming), LLMs accept natural-language input and require no expert training; unlike earlier task-oriented dialogue systems, they can be applied across arbitrary domains.

In my talk, I will explore the degree to which LLMs are already fulfilling this promise. I will present recent work on whether current LLMs "reason or recite" when solving NP-hard optimization problems and ongoing research on building dialogue agents that play two-player optimization games. I will conclude with some thoughts on future avenues of research.
