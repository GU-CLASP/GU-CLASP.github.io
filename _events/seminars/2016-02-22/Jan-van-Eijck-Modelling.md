Abstract: 

Jan van Eijck, CWI and ILLC, Amsterdam (http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jve/)

(joint work with Fengkui Ju, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China)

We use propositional dynamic logic and ideas about propositional controlfrom the agency literature to construct a simple model of how legalrelations interact with actions that change the world, and with actionsthat change the legal relations.

This work is relevant for attempts to construct restricted fragments of natural language for legal reasoning that could be used in the creation of (more) formal versions of legal documents suitable for `legal knowledge bases'.
