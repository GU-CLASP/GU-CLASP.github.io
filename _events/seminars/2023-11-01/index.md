Nina Tahmasebi and the Change is Key! team will introduce the Change is Key! program and some of our ongoing research. We will present the humanities and social science research questions that we will answer with the help of computational models of meaning and meaning change. In addition we will present ongoing work on word sense induction and modeling, semantic change across multiple time periods, and our work on large language models and their fit to historical data.
