Abstract
Artificial intelligence techniques are available for large languages such as English, but they can help us dramatically accelerate our documention work even in languages with very few resources. In this talk we will focus on breaking the transcription bottleneck by discussing how speech recognition can facilitate the task of transcription. We will also look at techniques such as automated parsing and machine translation which can be helpful when compiling corpora. We will also look at the impact that technologies can have in language revitalization, and how even simple tools like predictive keyboards can help in this work. The talk will focus on examples from the languages Bribri from Costa Rica and Cook Islands MƒÅori from Polynesia.
