In conversation, speakers tend to adapt their speech to be more similar to that of their interlocutor. Such alignment is observed across various linguistic phenomena. In this talk, we will consider linguistic style alignment and some ways to measure it. We will also explore whether lingistic style alignment is sensitive to social factors, such as social network centrality, or if it can be explained by automatic psychological priming alone.
