Title: Semantic change in interaction: Studies on the dynamics of lexical meaning

Abstract: This compilation thesis investigates how word meanings change. In
particular, it's concerned semantic change at the levels of
*interaction* and the *speech community*. To this end, the compiled
studies employ methods from both formal and computational semantics.

The first study presents a model for, and companion annotation study of,
*word meaning negotiation*, a conversational routine in which the
meaning of a word becomes an explicit topic of conversation. The next
two studies introduce and apply *classification systems*, a model of
communal conceptual resources for ordering and talking about a
particular domain. We use a formalization thereof to model how
*genus-differentia definitions* can be used in interaction to update
lexical knowledge of perceptual categories. The next study considers a
related phenomenon, *perceptual category description*, but this time
from a computational perspective. By modeling a short interaction
between two neural networks, we investigate how different ways of
representing perceptual categories affect linguistic grounding.
Following that, we turn to the dynamics of social meaning, particularly
the meaning of implicit conversational assumptions called *topoi*, with
a focus on situations of involving uncertainty about the speaker's
social identity. The final two studies of the thesis shift the focus
from particular interactions to the level of the community. First, we
investigate linguistic variation using *community conditioned language
models* to learn vector representations for a collection of online
communities. These language-based representations are found to correlate
with community representations based on community membership alone.
Finally, we use diachronic distributional word vectors to study
*short-term semantic shift* in online communities. We find that semantic
change has a significant yet nuanced relationship with the social
structure of the community. 
Altogether, the compilation offers two main insights. First, semantic plasticity is directly related to the complexity of the lexical semantic system. Words exhibit both perceptual and inferential meaning potential, each of which play a role in conveying and learning new words. Monolithic representations of word meaning belie a structured flexibility that guides how words can be used, while providing opportunities for innovation. It is this flexibility that is often the site of new conventionalized meanings. Second, semantic change is rooted in the interactive practices of the community. Communities sustain the communicative norms that govern how linguistic interaction takes place. These norms provide a framework for negotiating meaning. They also comprise the social and semiotic context that supports semantic innovation and change.
