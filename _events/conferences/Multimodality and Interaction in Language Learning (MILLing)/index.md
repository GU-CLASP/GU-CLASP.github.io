Multimodality and Interaction in Language Learning (MILLing) will bring together researchers in linguistics and computational linguistics to discuss learning through linguistic interaction, from the perspectives of both human language acquisition and machine learning. We encourage contributions from the fields of theoretical linguistics, experimental linguistics, pragmatics, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science.

The conference is organised by the Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability (CLASP, https://gu-clasp.github.io/), University of Gothenburg. The conference will be held between October 14 and 15 in Gothenburg, Sweden.
