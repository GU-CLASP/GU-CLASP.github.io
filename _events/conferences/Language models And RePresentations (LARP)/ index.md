Language models And RePresentations (LARP) brings together researchers that explore how information is structured, encoded and used in computational language systems. We encourage submissions on both neural (sub-symbolic) and discrete (symbolic) representations from the fields of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence of their intersection.

The conference is organised by [the Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability](https://gu-clasp.github.io/) (CLASP), University of Gothenburg. The conference will be held between September 8 and 9 in Gothenburg, Sweden.
